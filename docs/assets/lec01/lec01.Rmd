## Basics

### Technology?

Today, most people are _users_ of a computer. 

Simply put, they do **not** need to know how a computer works in order to use
  it. 

The majority of folks simply turn on technology and immediately see a graphic 
that they can click or tap with a finger.

Take for example getting a sports score from ESPN.  

Only _how_ to interact with a computer program is **known** _not_ the
behind the scenes aggregation of _data_, recognition of _gestures_, and so on.


### Computer == Scary?

This rationale has existed for awhile since computers are a bit scary...

Like spiders...

![Michigan Wolf Spider](wolf_spider.jpg)

### What is programming?

**Definition:**

*Programming* is the art of instructing a computer to do exactly what you say through an *algorithm*.

**Definition:**

*Algorithms* are a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.


### Why study programming now?

Programming has been available from the advent of computers. But, why am I hearing about it now?

\begin{center}
\Large 
What's changed?
\end{center}

A shift from working within **excel** to **automation**

\begincols
  \column{.5\linewidth}
```{r excel_spreadsheet, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '5cm', out.height = '4.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("excel.png")
```
  \column{.5\linewidth}
```{r php_code, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE,out.width = '4.5cm', out.height = '4cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("phpCode.png")
```
\endcols

Plus, a lot more CPU power on a traditional desktop.

### Benefits

The adoption of programming methods within ones skillset and organization has 
several notable benefits:

- Speed
- Consistency
- Resources
- Computer Savviness
- Logic


# Intro to R

### Learning a new language is HARD!

## Background of R

### What is _R_?

- _R_ is a language designed specifically for statistical computing and graphics
- _R_ is an interactive interface to many different tools.
- _R_ is based on the S language, which was developed by Bell laboratories
- _R_ is an open source (e.g. \textcolor{red}{free}) project that is cross platform
  (macOS, Windows, and Linux)
- _R_ is available on _The R Project for Statistical Computing_ website <http://www.r-project.org>


### Why _R_?

Pros:

- It's free!
- Large repository of packages that often contain the latest breakthrough statistical methods
- Able to integrate _Fortran_, _C_, _C++_, and _Python_ code via wrappers
- Large adoption of _R_ in industry and academia

Cons:

- Unable to handle large amounts of data
- Many idiosyncracies that break the mold of traditional programming languages

## RStudio IDE

### RStudio

RStudio is an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) for _R_. 

- Advanced GUI that emphasizes a project workflow
- Provides support for a novice user and an advanced user
- Open source (e.g. \textcolor{red}{free}) project that is cross platform 
  (macOS, Windows, and Linux)
- Download RStudio via [http://www.rstudio.com](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### RStudio View

```{r rstudio_client, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, out.width = '12cm', out.height = '12cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_view.png")
```

### Know thine RStudio Environment

There are a *lot* of keyboard shortcuts in RStudio ([Talk: Kevin Ushey](https://rawgit.com/kevinushey/2017-rstudio-conf/master/slides.html#1), [Talk: Sean Lopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuSQgswZdr8)). These shortcuts are meant to speed up your work. 

To view all the options, you must engage the keyboard shortcut that rules them all:

- Windows: `Alt` + `Shift` + `K`
- macOS: `Option` + `Shift` + `K`

```{r shortcut_key, out.width = "10cm", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("support/rstudio_env/shortcut_info.png")
```

### My Favorites

1. Runs the current line and/or current selection from the editor to the console and runs it
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `Enter` 
    - macOS: `Cmd` + `Enter`
1. Comment multiple lines.
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `C`	
    - macOS: `Command` + `Shift` + `C`
1. Multicursor: 
    - Both: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `Up` (or `Down`)
1. Reindent Code:
    - Windows: `Ctrl` + `L`
    - macOS: `Command` + `I`
1. Autocomplete command
    - Both: `Tab`
    
### Disable persistent workspaces

Within _R_, there is an option to have the persistent workspaces where previous
computations can be made available. However, this option often leads to
students and researchers quickly running into many unforseen difficulties.

- Not being able to reproduce the initial computation
- Slow program start up times
- Messy global environments.

Therefore, we believe it is important to disable this feature.

### Preparing your environment

Navigate to Tools $\Rightarrow$ Global Options

```{r rstudio_menu, out.width = "4cm", fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("support/rstudio_env/menu.png")
```

### Preparing your environment

- Uncheck `Restore .RData` into workspace at startup

- For `Save workspace to .RData on exit`, select the `Never` option from the dropdown. 

```{r default_rstudio, out.width = "5.5cm", fig.align='center', echo = F, cache = T}
knitr::include_graphics("support/rstudio_env/default_rstudio.png")
```

## Sample Code

### Warming up to _R_

To begin our exploration of the _R_ language, we'll use _R_ to mimic a 
scientific calculator. Scientific calculators are able to:

- Compute mathematical expressions.
- Temporarily store values in a variable.

Explanations of the code, are given by comments predated by a  `#`.

Output from the code is given by two `##`. 

### Storing Values and Calculations

```{r sample_r_storing, cache = TRUE}
```

### Vectors

In _R_, a number like **5** is treated as a vector, or a collection of values, 
with **length of 1**. 

We will see at a later time that this behavior, while odd, is actual pretty 
great to _vectorize_ computations.

### Vectors

\scriptsize
```{r sample_r_vectors, size = 'small', cache = TRUE}
```

### Built in Functions and Loops

Like any good programming language before it, _R_ has built in functions to aide
in the workflow.

A small sampling of functions is:

- `sum` - Summation over elements $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{x_i}}$
- `mean` - Average over elements $\bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{x_i}}$
- `sd` - Standard Deviation over elements $\sqrt {\frac{1}{{n - 1}}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{{\left( {{x_i} - \bar x} \right)}^2}} }$
- `sample` - Random sample from ${x_1}, {x_2}, \ldots, {x_i}, \ldots, {x_n}$

To view the function's help documentation, use:

```{r func_help, eval = F}
?function_name
```

### Built-in Functions & Loops

\scriptsize
```{r sample_r_functions, cache = TRUE}
```

# Types of Languages

### Talking to a Computer

- In order to talk to a computer, you must speak its dialect. 
- The dialect though is normally in 1's and 0's (or binary). 
- Until [Rear Admiral Grace M. Hopper](http://www.biography.com/people/grace-hopper-21406809) came along...

Now, we have the option of:

```{r compiler_vs_interpreter, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE,out.width = '10cm', out.height = '5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("compiler_vs_interpreter.jpg")
```

Image Source [StackOverflow: Interpreter vs. compiler](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31551282/1345455)

## Interpreters

### What is an Interpreter?

An _interpreter_ is a program that translates a high-level language into a low-level one, but it does it at the moment the program is run. 

So, the interpreter takes the source code, one line at a time, and translates each line before executing it every time the program runs.

Think of like a person providing a "real time translation" to a conversation.


```{r interpreter, cache = TRUE, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("support/interpreter/interpreter_standalone.pdf")
```

Image Source [StackOverflow: Interpreter vs. compiler](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31551282/1345455)

### Interpreters: Pros & Cons

As a result of the program being instantly translated, it is able to immediately
provide feedback (e.g. output, errors, etc).

For example, entering the following into R yields:

```{r int_example, cache = TRUE}
3+4
```

The downside to this approach are:

1. The lack of optimized code 
1. Constant translation


### Downsides of Interpreter Translation

Consider the effect of a slight change of code placement within a loop

\begincols
  \column{.5\linewidth}
```{r bad_loop, cache = TRUE, out.width='4cm',out.height='4cm'}
```
  \column{.5\linewidth}
```{r good_loop, cache = TRUE, out.width = '4cm', out.height = '4cm'}
```
\endcols

```{r benchmark_loop, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```

## Compilers

### What is a Compiler? Can it do my taxes?

A compiler takes source code tries to optimize it before converting it into machine language **once**. After it is done compiling, the code can then be ran again and again without ever needing to be recompiled until the code is changed once more.

So, a compiler is like an editor who is asked to look over a paper. If it thinks something can be better, then it will take the initiative and implement that option.

```{r compiler_support, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("support/compiler/compiler_standalone.pdf")
```

### Compilers: Pros

Compilers will attempt to optimize the code that they are given.

After a succesful compilation, the code will not need to be compiled again*.

\begincols
\column{.4\linewidth}
**Base _R_**
\tiny
```{r good_loop, cache = TRUE, out.width = '2cm', out.height = '4cm', size = 'tiny'}
```
\normalsize

\column{.6\linewidth}
**Bytecompiled *R***
\tiny
```{r compiler_ex, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE, out.width = '4cm', out.height = '4cm', size = 'tiny'}
```
\normalsize
\endcols

### Compilers: Cons

Compilers spend a lot of time analyzing and processing the program.

In order to analyze the program, they require the **ENTIRE** program to be sent.

There is additional storage requirement due to machine generated code.

Errors will only appear **AFTER** the entire program is analyzed.


### A looping example redux

After applying a compiler, there should be a noticeable change...

```{r compiler, cache = TRUE, out.width = '4cm', out.height = '4cm'}
```


```{r compiler_bench, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
```

Both of compiled version outperformed their respective interpreter version. However,
the "bad" loop was not optimized to match the performance of the "good" loop
due to limitations non-native compilation options.
