<h1 id="course-description">Course Description</h1>

<p>The world is rapidly evolving to rely on data driven decisions. These decisions
come from the work a statistician or data scientist presents in his or her
reports. In order to present an analysis, the analyst needs to be able to
leverage computing resources through programming to unearth patterns and models
that exist within data sets. As a result, statisticians and data scientists must
be savvy to programming methods that are useful to the wide variety of analysis
that they will be expected to perform.</p>

<p>For the focus of the course, fundamental programming techniques and
considerations will be introduced. Students will learn one of the leading
statistical programing languages in depth and will be well positioned to easily
learn others based on general principles. With this in mind, the course provides
a framework for writing statistical algorithms through the creation of functions
and object oriented programming. Students will also create dynamic reports that
encapsulate their code.</p>

<h1 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h1>

<p>After completing the course, students should be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analyze and discuss the meaning behind lines of code;</li>
<li>Construct implementations of a statistical algorithm within a statistical
computing environment;</li>
<li>Explain fundamental computing theory as it applies within the domain of
Statistics.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="course-content">Course Content</h1>

<p>Tentative subjects include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Paradigms:</strong> R, C++ (using Rcpp), OpenMP, bash, git, regex;</li>
<li><strong>Reproducible Research:</strong> <code>knitr</code>, <code>rmarkdown</code>, and <code>packrat</code>;</li>
<li><strong>Computing Theory:</strong> Control and scoping logic, big O, data structures,
              application program interfaces (APIs),
              and object-oriented programming;</li>
<li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Simple Linear Regression (SLR), Multiple Linear Regression (MLR),
              Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), and Probability Integral Transform;</li>
<li><strong>R packages:</strong> Construction of R-packages using <code>devtools</code>, <code>roxygen2</code>,
              <code>profvis</code>, and <code>testthat</code>;</li>

<ul>
<li>The course syllabus serves as the guiding document for the course and I&rsquo;m
unlikely to shift from it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>About the contents of homework.

<ul>
<li>It is better to ask the question during the start of class, office hours,
or on the discussion forum so that all students have access to the answer.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>If the question is more of a technical issue, have you tried to <strong>Google</strong> the
error verbatim (e.g. copy and paste it into Google)? Many error messages
that you will encounter have likely been solved by others. Try to seek out
pre-existing solution prior to querying me as it will allow you to gain
the highly sought after technical problem-solving capabilities.</p>

<h1 id="bug-bounty-program">Bug Bounty Program</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash; <strong>Paul R. Ehrlich</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>James is a <em>human</em>. As a result, he will sometimes introduce <em>bugs</em> as he types
into a computer. Though, he will try his very best to minimize the amount of
<em>bugs</em> in the course material.  If he does create a <em>bug</em>, please let him know.
Depending on the severity, you will be compensated with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Severe: Unintentionally, part of the code is fundamentally flawed.

<ul>
<li>Fix and/or patch is <em>required</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Bug Hall of Fame and 1 E.C. point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Medium: Logical flaws that occur during class.

<ul>
<li>Must explain the flaw and a potential solution</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Large candy bar of your choice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Trivial: Typos and Grammar

<ul>
<li>Minor nuisances that if corrected via a pull request will be appreciated.</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> For every 20 typos and grammar bits a large candy bar of your choice</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>As an added plus, there are many good discussions that come about due to mistakes&hellip;</p>

<h1 id="attendence">Attendence</h1>

<p>You are expected to attend all lectures. Failure to do so will have a direct
effect on your course grade due to <strong>five</strong> class participation points being
deducted on each absence. Please note, every student is eligible to miss <em>two</em>
class periods without needing to provide a reason. Any known or potential
extracurricular conflicts should be discussed in person with the instructor
during the first week of classes, or as soon as they arise. Please be proactive.</p>

<h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>

<p>There will be <strong>five</strong> homework assignments, each worth <strong>25</strong> points. None of
the homeworks will be dropped. Instead, you will have <strong>two</strong> late due date
<strong>extensions</strong> that will extend the original due date by <em>24 hours</em>.</p>

<h1 id="exam">Exam</h1>

<p>There is <strong>one</strong> midterm exam that is worth <strong>150</strong> points, which accounts for
<strong>30</strong> % of the overall course grade. The midterm will have an in-class portion
as well as a take-home portion that will be due within 24-48 hours after the
start of the exam. The take-home portion of the exam may not be discussed with
your classmates.</p>

<h1 id="group-project">Group Project</h1>

<p>During the semester, students are expected to work on a capstone project within
a group. The capstone project is meant to either showcase a newly implemented
statistical algorithms OR extend existing functions in other packages. The group
size should be <strong>between 2 to 3 students</strong>. There are four different graded
phases of the group project:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Proposal</strong></li>
<li><strong>Progress Update</strong></li>
<li><strong>Project Presentation</strong></li>
<li><strong>Final Project Report</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Each phases is worth <strong>43.75</strong> points making the overall project grade <strong>175</strong> points.</p>

<p>For each phase of the project, the group must provide an addendum page that
lists each group member and specifies how much that group member contributed to
that stage of the project out of <code>100%</code>. At the end, students will be asked to
perform <em>individual</em> peer evaluations of group members that may influence the
grades of students who do not contribute equally to the group project.
<strong>As a results, students should view project grades as being tentative.</strong></p>

<p>Furthermore, please make sure the following is present on each phase of
the group project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name of the Group</li>
<li>Group Member Names and NetIDs</li>
<li>Project Title</li>
<li>Phase of the Project</li>
</ul>

<p>The group project phases must be submitted through e-mail to balamut2 [at] illinois
[dot] edu. You are required to <strong>attach</strong> to the e-mail the report alongside
any supplementary files. All reports must be in PDF file format and saved as
<code>group_yourGroupNumber_projectphase.pdf</code>. Thus, if you are in Group 1 and working
on the <strong>Proposal</strong>, then the file would be saved as: <code>group_1_proposal.pdf</code></p>

<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>

<p>The project proposal should be <strong>at least 3 pages long but less than 5 pages</strong>.
Within the group project proposal, students should have the following sections:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong></li>
<li><strong>Related Work</strong></li>
<li><strong>Method</strong></li>
<li><strong>Feasibility</strong></li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li>
<li><strong>References</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Expectations regarding the contents of each section is outlined next. Make sure
to answer each question fully within the given section.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The <strong>introduction</strong> section provides a preview of the project&rsquo;s focus.
Within this section, provide an overview on the selected topic for the consumption
of a manager. In essence, the manager must be able to understand <em>what</em> the
project is and <em>why</em> they should support the endeavor. You are allowed to make
the assumption that the manager is knowledgeable in <em>base R</em> concepts. Make sure
to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What problem or topic are you addressing?</li>
<li>Why is it interesting or important? In particular, what evidence supports this conclusion?

<ul>
<li>Cite papers or reputable sources that back up this claim. (You may want to find material using <a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>.)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Where did the problem or topic come from?</li>
<li>What is your idea for addressing the problem or topic?</li>
<li>How does your idea match with the course’s focus on statistical programming?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="related-work">Related Work</h3>

<p>The <strong>Related Work</strong> section must provide an overview of pre-existing solutions.
In essence, please credit those who enabled you to consider embarking on this
project, or as Issac Newton in <a href="http://www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/OTHE00101">a letter to Robert Hooke on 15 February 1676</a> more
aptly put it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Address the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What other ideas have been attempted?</li>
<li>Why is your team&rsquo;s idea original compared to prior work?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="method">Method</h3>

<p>The <strong>Methods</strong> section should contain the overall details of the project
including any preliminary work. In particular, the implementation details
behind the approach should be explained at length here. The more details you
can provide, the better feedback your group can receive. As a result,
the section serves as a roadmap of what features are going to be developed and
any external dependencies that are required. To satisfy this section, provide
detailed responses for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is your general plan for realizing the idea?</li>
<li>Provide sketches of:

<ul>
<li>Visualizations</li>
<li>Function flows</li>
<li>Properties of classes</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What have you done or learned so far for the project?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="feasibility">Feasibility</h3>

<p>The <strong>Feasibility</strong> section is meant to act as a way to reflect upon the proposal.
Generally speaking, there will be four weeks of heavy development time afforded
to the group. Building a detailed ecosystem or heavily scripting in a different
language will likely not lead your team to success. Hence, please provide
a project management overview of <em>who</em> on your team will be doing <em>what</em> and <em>when</em>
by answering:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this project able to be completed before the end of the semester?</li>
<li>What steps must occur to complete the project before the end of the semester?</li>
<li>What is the work plan to accomplish the necessary tasks before the end of the
semester?

<ul>
<li>Specify who is doing what and when. Consider making a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart">Gantt chart</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>

<p>The <strong>References</strong> section acts as a bibliography for all papers referenced
in the <strong>Introduction</strong>, <strong>Related Works</strong>, and <strong>Method</strong> sections. The
references should be formated in Chicago author-date format, which is the
default for RMarkdown.</p>

<ul>
<li>Provide a list (5+) of papers or items you have read to write this proposal.</li>
<li>Please list all <em>R</em> packages or software referenced.</li>
</ul>

<p>To acquire software citation information, <em>R</em> has a built-in command
that creates a BibTex and in-line text citation. To generate the citation
of an installed <em>R</em> package, type:</p>

<pre><code class="language-r"># In R
citation(package=&quot;pkg_name&quot;)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="progress-report">Progress Report</h2>

<p>The project progress report should describe the present status of the project.
Specifically, please address:</p>

<ol>
<li>How is the project progressing?</li>
<li>What has been accomplished thus far?</li>
<li>What have you learned?</li>
<li>What issues have arisen?</li>
</ol>

<p>Please <strong>avoid</strong> including code snippets. However, clear functional output is
okay.</p>

<p>The score for the progress report is based on how much work has been completed
since the project proposal was initially submitted.</p>

<h2 id="presentations">Presentations</h2>

<p>There will be 15 minutes during class that is allocated to the presentation of
your project.  Please focus on the outcomes of the project. The score is based
solely on how well the project outcomes and methods used are conveyed. There
should be no more than 12 slides (not including references) in the presentation.</p>

<h2 id="final-report">Final Report</h2>

<p>Please prepare the final report using the following outline:</p>

<ol>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Related Work</li>
<li>Method</li>
<li>Results</li>
<li>Discussion</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
<li>References</li>
</ol>

<p>Reports will be graded based upon project outcomes, the execution of methods
described, and writing quality.</p>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>

<p>The course will use and present the <strong>R</strong> statistical computing language as well
as different parts of C++ through <a href="http://gallery.rcpp.org/">Rcpp</a>. The
integrated developer environment that we will use to explore <em>R</em> is
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/">RStudio IDE</a> made by
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio Inc</a>. You are free to use any language you
choose, but the course staff will only be able to provide support for <strong>R</strong>.
If you would like to use another statistical computing environment, please alert
the instructor ASAP to discuss feasibility.</p>

<p>Grades are not curved or adjusted. This is not to dishearten students, but to
let them know that their grade is based on individual effort and not on
comparative effort.</p>

<h1 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h1>

<p>The official University of Illinois policy related to academic integrity can be
found in Article 1, Part 4 of the Student Code. <a href="http://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1_part4_1-402.html">Section 1-402 in particular
outlines behavior which is considered an infraction of academic integrity.</a>
These sections of the Student Code will be upheld in the STAT 385 classroom.
Any violations will be dealt with in a swift, fair and strict manner.</p>

<p>You may discuss methods for completing the homework assignments with other
students, but the execution of these methods and the preparation of the document
must be done independently. Sufficient evidence of sharing results,
collaborating on written assignments, or simply relying on internet resources
will result in a score of 0 for the assignment and you will lose your right to
have any late submissions. There can be no discussion with other students or
collaboration of any kind on the take-home exams.</p>

<p>To ensure that you do not violate the academic integrity policies, all code and
solutions should be prepared yourself. All code should be typed yourself, <strong>not</strong>
copy and pasted. (Except for code provided in class or in the textbook.)</p>

<h1 id="changes">Changes</h1>

<p>The instructor reserves the right to make any changes he considers academically
advisable. Such changes, if any, will be announced in class. Please note that it
is your responsibility to attend the class and keep track of the proceedings.</p>

<p>Also, if changes are made&hellip;</p>
