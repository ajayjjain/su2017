# Data Management

## Motivation

### Data Management Techniques

- When talking about data management techniques, we're going to aim to make
things reproducible as always. 
- Thus, everything should be done within a scripted context.
- To advocate this approach, we're going to be looking at a sample project setup
and cleaning routine.

## Sample Project

### Example Project Setup & Files


- To follow along with the lecture, please visit the lecture 11 assets section
of the class website to obtain the example project
- **Link**
    - <https://github.com/stat385uiuc/su2017/tree/master/static/assets/lectures/lec11/project>


### Ideal Project Setup

Consider the following project directory structure:

\scriptsize
```{r eval = FALSE, engine='bash'}
|- Project
   |- data-raw/
      |- data.csv
      |- clean_data.R
   |- data/
      |- cleaned_data.rda
   |- R/
      |- analysis_script.R
   |- README.Rmd
   |- Project.Rproj
```

\normalsize

Notes:

- Anything related to cleaning data is within the `data-raw` directory.
- R code is contained to its own folder.
- `README.Rmd` file helps with understanding project contents.

###  OS Independent Load

Often times, we collaborate with a colleague through remote storage options 
such as [Dropbox](www.dropbox.com) and [BoxSync](https://app.box.com/). However,
if your colleague is running a Mac and you are running Windows, how can you keep
the same source files? 

\scriptsize

```{r os_independent_load, eval = FALSE}
# Example of an independent OS environment
os_name = Sys.info()[['sysname']]
if(os_name =="Windows") {
  fp = file.path("F:/BoxSync/stat385/lectures")
} else if(os_name =="Darwin") { # macOS
  fp = file.path("~/BoxSync/stat385/lectures")
} else { # Linux 
  stop("I'm a penguin.") 
}

script_path = file.path(fp, "lec11")
```


### Package Dependencies
Similarly, when sharing code, how can you make sure that the receiving party is
able to run it, without having to look through the code to figure out 
dependencies (i.e. `library()` or `require()`)? 

\scriptsize

```{r load_packs, eval = FALSE}
# Any package that is required by the script
# below is given here
inst_pkgs = load_pkgs =  c("MASS","faraway","Hmsic",
                           "randomForest","rpart")

# Check to see if the packages are already installed 
inst_pkgs = inst_pkgs[!(inst_pkgs %in%
                          installed.packages()[,"Package"])]

# Installs any missing package
if(length(inst_pkgs)) install.packages(inst_pkgs)

# Dynamically load required packages
pkgs_loaded = lapply(load_pkgs, require, character.only=T)
```


### Reading Data - R Core

The default ways to ingest data into _R_ are:

- **base R:** Text Files
    - `read.table()`: Read file in table format. 
    - `read.csv()` (US) / `read.csv2()` (Euro): Reads csv file
    - `read.delim()` (US) / `read.delim2()` (Euro): Reads deliminated file
    - **Note:** Decimal separators differ depending on locale
        - e.g. USA uses `,` whereas Europe uses `.` hence `csv`/`csv2`
- **[foreign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/foreign/):**  Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat, Weka, dBase, Octave

### Reading Data - Third Party

Two years ago, Hadley took it upon himself to write a lot of different file readers. 
In turn, these readers should be preferred as they are:
1. Faster and 2. Reliable

- **[readr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/index.html):** Text (.csv) 
    - `read_file():` Handles zipped files and `.txt`
    - `read_csv():` CSV
- **[readxl](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html):** Excel  
    - `read_excel()`: Reads in the first sheet (can be specified to others by name)
- **[haven](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/haven/index.html):** SAS, SPSS, and Stata 
    - `read_sas()`: Handles SAS `.b7dat` and `.b7cat`
    - `read_spss()`: Handles SPSS `.por` and `.sva`
    - `read_stata()`/`read_dta()`: Handles Stata `.dta`


### Load Multiple Data Sets

- Rarely is data ever in one source. Sometimes, data is found in a combination
  of **.csv** files with different filenames. 

\scriptsize

```{r load_multiple_datasets, eval = FALSE}
# Obtain a list of all files within active directory
# with extension .csv
filenames = list.files(pattern="*.csv")

dsAll = data.frame()
for (i in seq_along(filenames)) {
  # Assign each file to its filename
  assign(filenames[i], 
         read.csv(filenames[i], stringsAsFactors=FALSE))
  # Note: The stringsAsFactors = FALSE condition
  # prevents r from building levels into each variable.
  
  # Quick bind (bad implementation)
  dsAll = rbind(dsAll, filenames[i]) 
}
```

## Case Study: Housing Data

### Sample Data Clean

- For the next section, we will be focusing on the cleaning and formatting of data.

- Many of the ideas presented next were discussed by my good friend [**Michael Quinn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelquinn32). 

- Michael obtained a Masters in Statistics from UIUC while working as a
  MAGNET Intern at the State Farm RDC and now works on Google's Ad Team!

### Make a Rejection List

- When cleaning data, you will want to exclude an observation given a variable's
  specific value. 
- To handle such values, we create a '**Rejection List**.' The list will specify
  observations that should be removed from the data.
    - Here is an example of a rejection list called `reject_list.txt`:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
1002 w springfield ave
315 s state st
508 e soughton st
....
```

### Updating an Observation

- To update an observation, we look for a unique key to the observation.
    - In this case, it would be the house address. In other cases, it may be the
      Subject ID that is assigned. 
- For most of the cases, we will want to only update a part of an observation.

```{r house_mod, eval = FALSE}
# Find the row value
k = which(houses$St_Address == tolower("3909 Aberdeen Dr"))
# Update row value traits
houses$Bedrooms[k] = "3 beds"
houses$Bathrooms[k] = "2 baths"
houses$lot[k] = "3040 sqft"
houses$lastsoldifavailable[k] = "May 2011 for $135,000"
```

### Efficient Vectorized Cleaning

- To clean efficiently means to vectorize your cleaning approaches:

```{r clean_please, eval = FALSE}
# Removes any of the St_Addresses in the rejection list
houses = houses[!(houses$St_Address %in% reject),]
# Removes any duplicates
houses = unique(houses)
# Drop column range starting at heattype to floorcover
# heattype, zillowdays, cooling, parking, basement, 
# fireplace, floorcover.
start_loc = match("heattype",names(houses))
end_loc = match("floorcover",names(houses))
houses = houses[,-(start_loc:end_loc)]
# Removes variable headers in dataset
houses = houses[-which(houses$lastsoldifavailable
                       =="lastsoldifavailable"),]
```

## Tidy Data

### Concept of Tidy Data

> Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way
> 
> --- Hadley Wickham ([JSS Tidy data](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10))

In tidy data:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

### Data Shape

Consider the following data set:

```{r data_reshape}
experiment = read.table(header=TRUE, text='
 subject sex control a b
       S1   F     4.2  4.1  2.2
       S2   M     5.9  7.2  6.8
       S3   M     9.1  9.8  10.2
       S5   F     2.1  23.5  5.2
')

experiment
```

### Wide Data 

```{r data_reshape_wide}
experiment
```

- In its current form, the data is considered to be **wide**.
- **Wide Data** has repeated responses or treatments of a subject in a single row
with each response in its own column along with its properties.

### Long Data 

\scriptsize

```{r data_reshape_long, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
(data_long = gather(experiment, condition, measurement, control:b))
```

\normalsize

- With a little modification, the data is considered to be **long**.
- **Long Data** has each row as one response per subject and any variables for the subject that do not change over time or treatment will have the same value in all the rows.


### Wide Data to Long

- Use `gather` to move to a long format

```{r data_reshape_long_v2}
library(tidyr)
(data_long = gather(experiment, 
                    condition, measurement, control:b))
```

### Long Data to Wide

- Use `spread` to move to a wide format

```{r data_reshape_long_wide}
library(tidyr)
(data_wide =  spread(data_long, condition, measurement))
```


# Regular Expressions

## Motivation

### Regular Expressions

- **Regular Expression** or **regex**  is a sequence of characters 
that defines a search pattern for a collection of strings.
- The idea sprouted from the notion of a [**regular language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language)
that was brought into existence by Kleene's theorem written by Stephen Cole Kleene.
- **Regex** is primarily used to:
    1. search for patterns and,
    2. replace patterns
- For it to function, programmers have adopted a set of grammatical statements to 
build patterns for strings. 
- The grammar is available in just about every single programming language.

### Regular Expression Usage Cases

- Validate Data Entry Fields 
    - dates, e-mail address, credit card numbers
- Filter Text
    - key words or phrases in reviews, web server logs, reading config files
- Restructuring Text (Find and Replace)
    - mass change variable names, switching line endings
- Counting Occurrences
    - number of words, errors, or warnings

### Words of Wisdom for Regular Expressions

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
>
> --- Jamie Zawinski in [alt.religion.emacs](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.religion.emacs/DR057Srw5-c/n1WCMEw5iCkJ)

**Note:** Avoid using *regex* when parsers exist for tree structures (e.g. *html*/*dom*)
to prevent edge cases from not being picked up!

## Syntax

### Regular Expressions in R

| Function   | Description                                                  |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `grep`     | Returns a vector of the **indices** or **values** that match |
| `grepl`    | Returns a **logical** vector indicating matches              |
| `regexpr`  | Returns the starting position of the **first** match         |
| `gregexpr` | Returns the starting position of **all** matches             |
| `sub`      | Perform replacement of the **first** match                   |
| `gsub`     | Perform replacement of the **all** matches                   |

### Regex Example - Finding IL (Concatenation)

- Consider the need to *filter* terms by whether or not they include **IL**
(short for Illinois).

\scriptsize

```{r}
locs = c('Chicago, IL', 'San Francisco, CA', 'Springfield, IL',
         'Detroit, MI', 'Urbana, IL', 'Tampa, FL')

grep('IL', locs)               # Obtain the Indices
grep('IL', locs, value = TRUE) # Obtain the Names

grepl('IL', locs)              # Obtain logical response
```

### Regex Example - Finding IL (Concatenation)

- Find the locations within the string
    - If missing location returns **`-1`**

\scriptsize

```{r}
regexpr('IL', locs)  # Obtain the first instance in a word
gregexpr('IL', locs) # Obtain all instances in a word
```


### Regex Example - Removing `a` (Concatenation)

- Remove instances of the letter `a` from the text

```{r}
sub('a', "", locs)  # Remove first instance
gsub('a', "", locs) # Remove all instances
```

### Regex Operations

The operations for regex can be viewed in distinct groups.

- Foundational Operators
- Character Classes
- Quantifiers
- Anchors

### Regex Lexicon - Round 1 

| Operation      | Explanation                          | Symbol |  
|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------|
| Concatentation | Exact String                         |  word  | 
| Wildcard       | Any character                        | `.`    | 
| Union          | Either character                     | `|`    |
| Closure        | Match preceding character 0 or more  | `*`    | 
| Parentheses    | Matches a pattern group              | `()`   |

### Regex Lexicon - Examples for Round 1: Operators

| Operation      | Symbol | Example      | Match       | Failure  |
|----------------|--------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Concatentation |  word  | `james`      | james       | da yae   |
| Wildcard       | `.`    | `j.m.s`      | james/jomas | anmes    |
| Union          | `|`    | `jb | am`    | jjb / jam   | toad     |
| Closure        | `*`    | `cat*`       | catcat / ca | ma / at  |
| Parentheses    | `()`   | `(og)`       | dog / blog  | dgs      |

### Regex Lexicon - Round 2: Classes

- A **character class** is a *list* of characters enclosed between `[ ]` that
  matches *any single character* in that list.
- **Exception:** If the first character in the list is the caret 
  `^` (e.g. `[^]`) than it matches any character not in the list. 
- For example, the regular expression `[0123456789]` matches any *single* digit,
  and `[^abc]` matches anything except the characters `a`, `b` or `c`. 

| Operation      | Explanation                              | Symbol  |  
|----------------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| Class Matches  | Match within specific classes            | `[]`    | 
| Range          | Match values within a range              | `[-]`   |
| Negations      | Match any character not within           | `[^]`   |

### Regex Lexicon - Examples for Round 2: Classes

| Operation      | Symbol |  Example        | Match          | Failure      |
|----------------|--------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Class Matches  | `[]`   | `[abc]`         | toad / book    | room / desk  |
| Range          | `[-]`  | `[a-zA-Z]`      | Funky / word   | 1234 / `#$@` |
| Negations      | `[^]`  | `[^aeiou]`      | gst / wd       | hi / orange  |


### Regex Lexicon - Character Class Shortcuts

| Operation      |   POSIX      | Regex Default   | Regex Shortcut |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Space          | `[:space:]`  | `[ ]`           | `\s`           |
| Blank Chars    | `[:blank:]`  | `[ \f\n\r\t\v]` | `\s`           |
| Digits         | `[:digit:]`  | `[0-9]`         | `\d`           |
| Lower          | `[:lower:]`  | `[a-z]`         |                |
| Upper          | `[:upper:]`  | `[A-Z]`         |                |
| Punctuation    | `[:punct:]`  |  Not listed     |                |
| Alphanumeric   | `[:alnum:]_` | `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`  | `\w`           |
| Alphabetic     | `[:alpha:]`  | `[a-zA-Z]`      |                |

Notes:

- POSIX shortcuts adjust to locale vs. regex default.
- **All POSIX values must be wrapped in `[]`**
    - e.g. `[[:alpha:]]` gives the alphabetic characters, for more see `?regex`

### Regex Lexicon - Round 3: Quantifiers

| Operation      | Explanation                              | Symbol  |  
|----------------|------------------------------------------|---------|
| At Most Once   | Match preceding character 0 or 1 times   | `?`     |
| One or More    | Match preceding character 1 or more      | `+`     |
| Exact Amount   | Match exactly $m$ occurences             | `{m}`   | 
| At Least       | Match at least $m$ occurences            | `{m,}`  | 
| At Most        | Match at most $n$ occurences             | `{0,n}` | 
| Between        | Match $m \le x \le n$ occurences         | `{m,n}` |

| End            | `$`    | `s$`            | james / dogs   | sam / sosa   |


### Regex Escape sequences


| Character                   | Sequence  | 
|-----------------------------|-----------|
| Single Quote                | `\'`      |
| Double Quote                | `\"`      |
| Newline                     | `\n`      | 
| Carriage Return             | `\r`      |
| Tab                         | `\t`      |
| New Page (Form Feed)        | `\f`      |
| Bell Character              | `\a`      |


### Regex Backreferences

- Regex has a nice feature that provides: **backreferences**
- Definition: **Backreferences** enable the retrieval of values within side
the parantheses grouping option given by `()`. This is helpful when doing string
replacement.
- Each `()` group is assigned a number $n$ that can be referenced with `\\n`.

```{r}
(backref = c("xy","xyz","xayz","x12z"))

gsub("(xy)","\\1stats",backref)
```


### Interesting regex equivalences

Contained below are equivalent regex expressions

- e.g. $op1 == op2$

| OP 1      | OP 2       |  Equivalence Remark       |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------|
|   `a+`    |   `aa*`    |  Replicates pattern       |
| `a(b|c)d` | `a[bc]d`   | If **single** characters! |
| `a{0,1}`  |   `a?`     |     Optional pattern      |

## Case Study: House Addresses

### Extracting and Formatting regex Example

- Data may sometimes not come formatted to the necessary requirements. 
- One variable might need to be split up among multiple variables.  
- This is an ideal case for using [regular expressions](http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html) (`?regex`).

### Extracting and Formatting

- In the housing data, the house address is stored as:

"[#### Street Name] , [City], [State] [Zipcode]"

- We would like to split this data into three new variables:
    - **St_Address**, Zipcode, and City.

- Note, we will want to use the lower case alphabet to prevent capitalization 
mismatches within alphabetical fields. (e.g. "harbor estates ln" $\ne$ "Harbor Estates Ln")

## Extracting and Formatting

**House_Address:** [#### Street Name] , [City], [State] [Zipcode]

```{r extract_format, eval = FALSE}
# Create a temporary variable with strings in lower case
address = tolower(as.character(houses$House_Address))
# Regex: The . means any character
# Regex: The * uses greedy evaluation [repeats]
street = gsub(" ,.*", "", address)
houses$St_Address = street 
# Replace city name with 0 or 1.
city = gsub(".*, champaign, .*", "0", address)
city = gsub(".*, urbana, .*", "1", city)
houses$City = as.numeric(city) # Make numeric
# Extract the zip code
zip = gsub(".* , .*, il ", "", address)
houses$ZipCode = as.numeric(zip)
# Delete old House_Address
houses$House_Address = NULL
```

# Dates and Times

## Motivation

### Date and Time Formats

> "The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once."
>
> --- Albert Einstein

- *R* has the ability to interface with time information.
- The interface, as we will see, may not be the best but it is highly versatile. 
- This is important in a world that is going more and more global.

Sys.Date()             # Returns a date as R's Date object

Sys.time()             # Returns both date & time at current locale as POSIXct

as.numeric(Sys.time()) # Seconds from UNIX Epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)

Sys.timezone()         # Time zone at current location
```

## Operations on Time

### Date and Time Formats - Failure of `characters`

- Frequently, dates and times will be given as `characters` within a `data.frame`
- Having dates as `characters` impedes ones ability to be able to use the time
information in an analysis 
    - For example: How long did it take for the help desk call to be completed?

```{r bad_time, eval = FALSE}
# Bad Time Differencing:

time1 = "2016-06-28 10:25:44 CDT" # UNIX Time Stamp
time2 = "2016-06-28 15:25:44 CDT" # UNIX Time Stamp
time2 - time1
# Error in time2 - time1 : non-numeric argument to
# binary operator
```


### Date and Time Formats - Time Operations

- Performing time operations requires that both dates are given as `POSIXct`
object in *R*.

```{r good_time}
time1 = as.POSIXct("2016-06-28 10:25:44")
time2 = as.POSIXct("2016-06-28 15:25:44") # +5 Hours
time2 - time1
```

**Note:** Default format for `POSIXct` is `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`

### Formating Non-Standard Dates

```{r}
(yyyy_mm_dd = as.POSIXct("2016-06-28",
                         format = "%Y-%m-%e"))

(dd_mm_yy = as.POSIXct("28/06/16",
                       format = "%e/%m/%y"))

(mon_dd_yyyy = as.POSIXct("Jun 28, 2016",
                         format = "%b %e, %Y"))
```

### Formating Non-Standard Times

```{r time_nonstandard}
(h_m = as.POSIXct("11:38",
                         format = "%H:%M"))

(h_am = as.POSIXct("11 AM",
                       format = "%I %p"))

(h_m_s_z = as.POSIXct("11:38:22", # Chop off the TZ 
                         format = "%H:%M:%S",
                         tz = "America/New_York"))
```

### Time Zone Notes

- *R* makes use of time zones via `tz` parameter.
- The accepted values of `tz` depend on the location.
    - `CST` is given with `"CST6CDT"` or `"America/Chicago"`
- For supported locations and time zones use:
    - In R: `OlsonNames()` 
    - Alternatively, try in R: `system("cat $R_HOME/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab")`
- These locations are given by [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) 
    - [List of tz database time zones (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)
    - [IANA TZ Data (2016e)](http://www.iana.org/time-zones/repository/releases/tzdata2016e.tar.gz) 

### Specifics on `POSIXct` 

- `POSIXct`: Stores time as seconds since UNIX epoch on `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
    - Unix & tidyverse preferred format.

\scriptsize

```{r consider_posixct}
# POSIXct output
(origin = as.POSIXct("1970-01-01 00:00:00",
                    format ="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
                    tz = "UTC"))

as.numeric(origin)     # At epoch

as.numeric(Sys.time()) # Right now
```

# Misc

## `POSIXlt`

### The "other" time object: `POSIXlt`

- `POSIXlt`: Stores a list of day, month, year, hour, minute, second, and so on. 
    - It is **slower** than `POSIXct` and has **zero support** in the tidyverse.
    - **Warning:** `POSIXlt` will be returned if you use `strptime()`
    - Always convert `POSIXlt` to `POSIXct` using `as.POSIXct()`!!!
   
```{r consider_posixlt}
# POSIXlt output
posixlt = as.POSIXlt(Sys.time(),
                    format ="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S",
                    tz = "America/Chicago")

# Convert to POISXct
posixct = as.POSIXct(posixlt)
posixct
```

### `POSIXlt` - List Values

\tiny

```{r consider_posixlt_list}
posixlt$sec   # Seconds 0-61
posixlt$min   # Minutes 0-59
posixlt$hour  # Hour 0-23
posixlt$mday  # Day of the Month 1-31
posixlt$mon   # Months after the first of the year 0-11
posixlt$year  # Years since 1900.
```

## anytime

### anytime

- [`anytime` by Dirk Eddelbuettel](https://cran.r-project.org/package=anytime)
  seeks to solve the need of remembering date and time formats.
- Main advantage: Only one function `anytime()` that autodetects the appropriate
  format and imports it correctly as a `POSIXct` object.

\scriptsize
```{r example_anytime}
library(anytime)
Sys.setenv(TZ=anytime:::getTZ()) ## helper function to try to get TZ

anytime(c("2017-Jul-10 10:11:12", "Jul/10/2017 10:11:12", "Jul-10-2017 10:11:12"))
anytime(c("Mon Jul 10 10:11:12 2016", "Mon Jul 10 10:11:12.345678 2017"))
```

## lubridate

### `lubridate` - Dates Made Easy

- [`lubridate` by Garret Grolemund, Hadley Wickham, and Gang](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate)
  contains **many** helper functions to write the correct parse syntax e.g.
  
```{r example_lubridate, message=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
ymd("20160628")
interval(mdy("06-28-2016"), dmy("29/06/2016"))
```

For more, please read the [Lubridate vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)
on the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=lubridate)


### Summary

- To analyze time, you must have it in a `POSIXct` object 
    - Avoid `POSIXlt` like the plague.
- Date and Timestamps differ greatly around the world.
- Lots of options outside of base R functions exist.
