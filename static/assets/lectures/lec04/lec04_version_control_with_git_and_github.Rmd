# Intro 

## Background

### What are Version Control Systems?

**Version Control Systems (VCS)** are applications that seeks to provide a way
to _manage_ and _track_ the evolution of work done on a project.

### How does it work?

Think of a VCS like a camera. Each time you take a picture, time is being "frozen"
in place and stored in a photo album.

```{r young_to_old, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/young_to_old.jpg")
```

In essence, an _incomplete_ history of your project will be etched into stone.

### Why is the history incomplete?

> The pictures do not lie, but neither do they tell the whole story. 
> They are merely a record of time passing, the outward evidence.
>
> --- Paul Auster, [Travels in the Scriptorium](https://www.amazon.com/Travels-Scriptorium-Paul-Auster/dp/B006W46NI6)

- Granularity of change
- Developers come and go; so does the context

## Pros and Cons

### It's time to have 'the talk' about how we name files...

```{r bad_file_names, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/file_names.png")
```

Inspired by [PhD Comics: A Story told in File Names](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php/tellafriend.php?comicid=1323)

### Redux of File Naming

Under version control, the previous file structure would be changed to:

```{r ideal_file_names, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/ideal_file_names.png")
```

- All changes to the cleaning script and cleaning data set are stored
  within the VCS. 
- **There is no need to label _version_ information within the
  file name.**

### Example of Versioning

```{r vcs_vs_file_meta, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='11cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vcs-file-flow/vcs-vs-file-meta.png")
```

### Pros v. Cons

#### Benefits of VCS

- Abridged history changes to your project
- Ability to transverse the space-time continuum 
- Try out _new_ ideas without worrying about breaking something!
- Collaborate with others _without_ waiting for their component to be finished
- Continuous Integration (CI) allows for problems to be detected early

#### Downsides of VCS

- Not user-friendly
- Takes a bit of **time** and **practice** to understand.
- Windows support normally _lags_ behind macOS and Linux


## Why `git`?

### VCS Options

There are many VCS that are available:

- [`git`: git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [`svn`: Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/)
- [`cvs`: Concurrent Versions System](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/)

However, the general consensus is that `git` is the **best** because:

- It's free
- Multi-platform
- Rapidly growing ecosystem 
- Distributed versioning model
- Large industry support

Therefore, the focus of the course will be in working with `git`.

### Distributed Model vs. Centralized Model

- `git` uses a **distributed model** that gives 
  _everyone_ a copy of the repository.
    - Making and distributing digital copies of the party's photos.
- Other VCS opt for a **centralized model** that requires everyone to
  be connected to a server to individually check out files.
    - Think of checking out the only book at a library.

## Terminology

### `git` Terminology

There are _many_ terms associated with a `git` workflow. 

We'll explore a few of those terms next.

### General Terms

- **HEAD** refers to the point in time one is currently viewing.
- **Stage** is a holding area that indicates what files should be captured.
    - Place where pictures are being prepared to be taken.
- **Commits** are the saved records of the staged files.
    - Photos _taken_ on the stage.
- **Repositories** ("repos") hold all the **commits** to the project.
    - Photo ablum containing the photos.
- **Branches** experiments that do _not_ influence the state of the **repo**
    - New ways to take pictures _without_ affecting previously taken pictures. 
- **Master** is the default **branch** that **commits** are saved to 
    - General photo album of life.
- **Checkout** changes the **branch** being viewed or moves the **HEAD** back to a specific **commit**.
    - Open the photo album to a specific point in time or experiment.

### Repository Diagram

```{r git_local_branch, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vcs-file-flow/git-local-branch.png")
```

### Sync Terms

- **Cloning** creates a copy of the **repo** onto ones computer.
    - Downloading the photo album in its entirety from the _cloud_.
- **Local** refers to the copy of the **repo** on your computer.
    - Photo album on your computer.
- **Remote**/**Upstream** location of where the **repo** was **cloned** from.
    - Where the photo album is stored in the _cloud_.
- **Origin** typically the name given to the **remote** location. 
    - Nickname of the location of the photo album in the _cloud_.
- **Pull** retrieve commits from the **remote repo**.
    - Download _new_ pictures from the _cloud_ to your local album.
- **Push** send commits from  the **local repo** to the **remote**.
    - Upload _new_ pictures to the _cloud_ photo album.
    
### Repository Diagram with Remotes

```{r git_remote_diag, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/vcs-file-flow/git-remote-diag.png")
```

# GitHub

## Background

### What is GitHub?

```{r github_logo, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='1.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-logos/github-octo.png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-logos/github-logo.png")
```

- Popular place to setup a remote repository
    - Over 14 million users and 35 million repos as of April 2016
- Provides a web interface for `git`
    - Search the space-time continuum of your project
- Promotes open source tenets 
    - _View_ code instantly for any large open source project.

### Why use GitHub?

- Improves the user experience for using `git`
    - Visually explore code differences
- Enables collaboration with others via pull requests (PRs) and issue tickets
    - Changes the paradigm from _asking_ for a fix to _providing_ a fix 
- Social media for the programmer
    - News feeds that track what your favorite programmer / projects are up to
- Accessible from all over the world 
    - Except in China...

## Accounts

### Create a GitHub Account

Register an account on [GitHub](http://github.com) using your `@illinois.edu`
e-mail address.

```{r github_reg, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/github_reg.png")
```

### Request a Student Account

Place a request using [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/discount_requests) to obtain **unlimited** free private repositories. Also, consider forming an organization, which is able to receive **unlimited** free private repositories with fine permission control. 

```{r ed_discount, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm', out.height='5.75cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/ed_discount.png")
```

### Fill in your GitHub Profile

After you create an account, feel free to fill in your profile information
by clicking on the **down arrow** in the upper right hand corner and selecting **Settings**

```{r git_profile, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm', out.height='5.75cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/git_profile.png")
```

### Star and Follow the Course Repository

Receive updates when the course repository gets updated by **Watching** and
**Starring** the course repository <https://github.com/stat385uiuc/su2017>

```{r git_star_me, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm', out.height='5.75cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/git_star_me.png")
```

### BitBucket: An alternative to GitHub

Dislike GitHub? Consider using [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/). The repositories are generally more closed source than GitHub. However, for researchers and students, BitBucket provides [unlimited private repositories with unlimited contributors](https://www.atlassian.com/software/views/bitbucket-academic-license.jsp).

```{r bitbucket_reg, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='7cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/bitbucket_reg.png")
```

# Git

## Setup

### Tutorial

Please follow the tutorial to setup git found here:

<http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/tutorials/downloading-and-installing-git/>

## Workflow

### `git` Commands

Unlike the shell commands, where each command was separated (e.g. `head`, `tail`),
`git` has a series of verbs associated with a single command aptly named `git`.

To use `git` commands use the form of:

```bash
git <verb>
```

To obtain help regarding a specific command, use:

```bash
git <verb> --help
man git-<verb>
```

### General Workflow Overview

The general workflow with `git` is as follows

```{bash}
git init       # Create a repo or initialize an prior repo
git pull       # Retrieve latest commits from remote repo
git status     # Figure out the state of files
git add <file> # Stage a specific file(s) to be commited
               ## OR ##
git add .      # All files within the working directory
git commit     # Commit the staged file(s) into the repo
git status     # Verify the proper files have been committed
git push       # Sync to remote repository
```


### Initializing a Repository

The initialization of a `git` repository requires the directory to be empty.

- Create an empty directory called `helloworld` and change into the directory.
```{bash}
mkdir helloworld && cd helloworld
```
- Initialize a new git repository
```{bash}
git init
```

### Adding Sample Content

To add content, first create a file using `touch` and then open it with your
favorite CLI editor.

```{bash}
touch readme.md
vi readme.md
```

```{r empty_initial_file, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='8.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/empty_initial_file.png")
```

### Enable Insert Mode

To be able to add text via a CLI, you must enter into **`INSERT`** mode.
This is accomplished by pressing **`i`** or the **`Insert`** button.

```{r initialize_insert, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/initialize_insert.png")
```
Note, in the bottom left of terminal, the word **`INSERT`** appears.

There are a few other ways to active **`INSERT`** mode detailed here:
<http://vi.stackexchange.com/a/5635>

### Example of Content

If you wish, feel free to type in the following:

```
# Example git workflow

Within this repository we will be practicing how to commmit
with git.
```

### Example of Content in CLI Editor

```{r sample_file_contents, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/sample_file_contents.png")
```

### Saving and Closing the CLI Editor

To close and save the file, press **`ESC`** and then type **:wq**. 

In instances where you do _not_ want to modify the file but close it, use **`:q!`**

```{r write_change_and_quit, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/write_change_and_quit.png")
```

### Checking the Status of `git`

Often it is helpful to know the present status of `git`. The status tells you:

- Untracked files 
    - Yet to be staged
- Staged files
    - Need to be committed into the repo
- File conflicts from mergs 
    - More on this later...

Check with:

```{bash}
git status
```

### Checking the Status of `git`

```{bash}
git status
```

\scriptsize
```{bash, eval = FALSE, size="scriptsize"}
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   readme.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```


### Stage the File

To prepare the file for inclusion within our repository, we must first _stage_ it.
By staging the file, we are telling `git` that we intend for the file to be
apart of the next `commit`.

```{bash}
git add readme.md
```

**Note:** There will be _no_ output indicating whether the file is staged.


### Checking the Status of `git`

Let's verify the file has been _staged_ by running a `status` check:

```{bash}
git status
```

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   readme.md
```


### Writing a Commit Message

With the file now staged, the file can be included within the repository by
committing it. All commits must have a comment indicating what is being commited
into the repository.

There are two forms of commits:

- Long form: `git commit` (spawns CLI)
- Short form: `git commit -m "Message here"`

Depending on the project, there may be a preference for one over the other.

### Preferred Git Commit

The preferred `git` commit is done with:

```
Short description of 50 characters indicating a change

Long description of what changed and why the change was
necessary. This description may be multilined.
```

**Note:** There are two returns between the short and long description.

### The Reality

```{r git_commit, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='8cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/comic/git_commit.png")
```

Source [XKCD: Git Commit](https://xkcd.com/1296/)

### The Long Form `git commit`

View when entering into a proper long form `git` commit.

```{r entering_git_commit, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/entering_git_commit.png")
```


### The Long Form `git commit`

1. Enable **`INSERT`** mode
2. Write the long form `git commit`
3. Exit from the CLI text editor using **`:wq`**

```{r exiting_git_vim, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git-walk/exiting_git_vim.png")
```

### Did you forget to introduce yourself?

If during your first commit, you received:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
```

You will need to introduce yourself to git! Otherwise, it won't be a very
productive partnership.

### Result of the Commit

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
[master (root-commit) 780ef6c] Added Added a readme file
 1 files changed, 4 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 readme.md
```

### Create a GitHub Repository

```{r create_repo, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='11cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/create_repo.png")
```

### Create a GitHub Repository

When establishing the repository, consider adding a license to your code.

```{r repo_details, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='9cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/repo_details.png")
```

### Obtain GitHub Repository Link

```{r copy_repository, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/git/copy_repository.png")
```

### Add the Remote

To let your local git repository know about the new remote we must use:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin <github_url>
```

In my case that would be:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote add origin git@github.com:coatless/helloworld.git
```

### Verify the Remote

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git remote -v
```

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
origin  git@github.com:coatless/helloworld.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:coatless/helloworld.git (push)
```

### Push the changes

To send your changes to the remote simply:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
git push
```

Though, there are two key issues that may arise:

1. The dreaded merge conflicts.
2. You must be authenticated on GitHub with an `ssh` key.

## Merge Conflict

### Merge Conflicts

To address merge conflicts take the following steps:

1. Figure out the files that are in conflict by using `git status`
2. Open each conflicted file.
3. Decide which change set to keep or remove.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Change in the local file
=======
Change that someone made in the remote file
>>>>>>> 5e2443102fbf316b88dc3cd3922bc680668de655
```

- `<<<<<<<` - Beginning of merge conflict where _YOUR_ changes reside
- `=======` - The end of your changes and the beginning of the remotes
- `>>>>>>>` - End of the remotes changes for that merge section conflict.

### Merge Conflicts

To retain my commit, I delete all other changes.

**Before:**
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
<<<<<<< HEAD
Change in the local file
=======
Change that someone made in the remote file
>>>>>>> 5e2443102fbf316b88dc3cd3922bc680668de655
```

**After:**
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
Change in the local file
```

Then `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` my changes.

## Authorization

### Authorizing...

One of the downsides of pushing to GitHub is the need to be authenticated...

```{r review_changes, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project/review_changes.png")
```

### Good Authorization via Public and Private SSH Keys

To simplify this process, we opt to authorize ourselves to GitHub using an encryption technique that uses a **public and private key scheme**.

In this case, the public key is a string of symbols that is out there for the world to see. 

On the other hand, the private key is considered to be confidential and only viewable by its owner. 

This scheme enables messages signed with the private key to only be viewable via its public key (and vice versa).

### Good Authorizing - SSH Key Generation

Instructions for generating an SSH key are given in two flavors:

1. Using RStudio's GUI
1. Using Shell/Terminal

You only need to pick **one** route.

\textbf{You can now officially commit via SSH.}

### Good Authorizing - SSH Key Generation

As promised, next up are the instructions for SSH key generation within Terminal/Shell...

\Large
\centering
Do \textbf{NOT} repeat this if you opted for to generate the SSH key using the RStudio approach.

### Good Authorizing - SSH Authorization via Terminal

Use SSH Authorization by opening terminal/shell 

(in RStudio access it via Tools $\rightarrow$ Shell)

\scriptsize
```{bash git_os_x, size='scriptsize'}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" # Creates new SSH Key

# After the key is generated, you will be prompted with
Enter a file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]

# Create a password for the key (needs to be rememberable)
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

# Start the SSH Agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add the key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

###

Copy key to clipboard

Windows:
```{bash, git_win, size='footnotesize'}
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

macOS:
```{bash git_mos, size='footnotesize'}
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Then we add the key to GitHub using the previous steps... 

### Bad Authorizing - Revealing Login Information

Sometimes, `ssh` may be limited due to the internet options you have at your
disposal. At times like this, there is one last option. 

**Authenticate over HTTPS.**

The approach detailed next is suboptimal as you end up having to _store_ your
login credentials alongside the repository URL.

### Bad Authorization - Use this approach when everything fails

\begin{center}
\textcolor{red}{This is a very bad option since R Studio does NOT hash .proj files.}
\end{center}

When you enter in your GitHub repository to create your R Project, append your username and password like so to the URL:

```{bash git_bad}
https://username:password@github.com/username/helloworld.git
```


# RStudio with `git`

## Sample Workflow

### RStudio `git` Client

Previously, details were given as to how to work _solely_ with a CLI `git` client.

However, RStudio does have a built in `git` client that is not necessarily ideal.
But, definitely worth mentioning in the scope of this `git` tutorial. The reason
is because there are a few limitations to the client and it also involves using
a GUI.

### Create a new RStudio Project
