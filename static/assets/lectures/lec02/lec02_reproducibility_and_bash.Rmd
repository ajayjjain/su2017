# Reproducible Research

## Definition

### What is Reproducible Research?

**Reproducible research** or creating a **reproducible analysis** is the idea that the 
experiment's collected data, data analysis code, and derived principal results 
are assembled in a way so that another body is able to re-create all of the
results (e.g., data formatting, parameter estimates, figures, tables, and so on). 

In essence, reproducible research seeks to satisfy a very minimal portion of how
to obtain _replicable_ results typically used to promote scientific theories.

### Reproducible vs. Replicable

In general, there are [lots](http://cogprints.org/7691/7/ICMLws09.pdf) of
[papers](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2011/07/01/trust-your-science/) that 
debate what the definitions of Reproducible and Replicable are. 


For our purpose, we will consider the viewpoint of 
[Prof. Roger Peng of the Journal of Biostatistics](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/334/6060/1226.full) - held as the [Journal's standard](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/405.full) - and [echoed by Prof. David Banks](http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/Supplements/ReproRsch-All/Modified/ENAR/banksNotes.pdf), former editor of the prestigious Journal of the
American Statistical Association (JASA).

\begin{description}
\item[Reproducible] if there is a specific set of computational 
functions/analyses (usually specified in terms of code) that exactly reproduce
all of the numbers in a published paper from raw data.
\item[Replicable] if you perform the exact same experiment (at least) twice, 
collect data in the same way both times, perform the same data analysis, and 
arrive at the same conclusions. 
\end{description}

## Being a Practitioner

### Importance of Reproducible Research

Many issues have arisen over the recent years regarding reproducibility...

- [Nature: 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970):
    - "More than 70% of researchers have tried and failed to reproduce another scientist's experiments, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments."
- [JAMA: Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects
  in Highly Cited Clinical Research](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/201218)
    - "Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective. Of these, 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were replicated, and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged.
- [Nature: Over half of psychology studies fail reproducibility 
  test](http://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248)
    - "Whereas 97% of the original studies found a significant effect, only 36% of replication studies found significant results."
- [RetractionWatch: Tracking retractions](http://retractionwatch.com/)

### Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics

In the book, [_How to Lie with Statistics_](https://www.amazon.com/How-Lie-Statistics-Darrell-Huff/dp/0393310728)
by Darrell Huff, a notable issue that
is emphasized is the ease with which an incorrect intepretation can easily
lead to an inappropriate conclusion that is **published**.

```{r lie_with_stats, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='10cm', out.width='8cm'}
```

### Real Life Example: Excel Breaking an Analysis

#### Paper Credit

[Does High Public Debt Consistently Stifle Economic Growth? A Critique of Reinhart and Rogoff](https://www.peri.umass.edu/publication/item/526-does-high-public-debt-consistently-stifle-economic-growth-a-critique-of-reinhart-and-rogo-ff)

by: Thomas Herndon, Michael Ash, Robert Pollin

### Why Practice Reproducible Research?

By structuring research or an analysis so that it is reproducible, not only is 
the work more useful but also the overload on the practitioner is reduced.

The overload is reduced since the hope of reproducible research is to put an end
to the practice of copying and pasting results into documents, asymmetric data
modifications in excel, and undocumented code.

As they say...

If you do something \textit{by hand} once, you'll end up doing it at least 20
times.

## Workflow

### Types of Workflow

There are two ways to interact with a computer:

- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Text-based commands issued by a keyboard
  that receive text-based responses from the computer.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Point-and-click command that elicits a
  visual response which changes the program's state.
  
What interface do _you_ think is the preferred way to structure a _reproducible_
project?

### Sample Point and Click Map with Overlay

```{r ps_4hours_overlay, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/interfaces/ps_4hours_overlay.jpg")
```

Source [IOGraphica: 4 hours of Mouse Movements in Photoshop](http://iographica.com/)

### Sample CLI History

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
Last login: Tues Jun 13 13:31:45 on ttys003
wirelessprv-10-193-53-59:~ agentxyz$ history
    1  pwd
    2  ssh balamut2@cc-login.campuscluster.illinois.edu
    3  cp -R ~/stat385/su16/lec17 ~/stat385/su17/lec2/
    4  ls
    5  mkdir hellostat385
    6  cd hellostat385/
    7  git init
```

### Ideal Work Flow

```{r workflow, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='12cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tikz/workflow.pdf")
```

Only raw data exists outside of the ecosystem. 

All blue boxes are done with a script to ensure reproducibility.

### The Power of Scripts

```{r focused_workflow, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='11cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tikz/focused-workflow.pdf")
```

\begin{columns}[t]

### The Best Reason to Practice Reproducible Research...

#### 

James,


Hope all is well. Prof. _Toad_ accidently sent us the wrong data set. Please see the
forwarded e-mail and redo the analysis using the new data set. If possible,
could we discuss the results on Wednesday?

Thanks,

Steven

# Tools of Reproducible Research

## Overview

### Software of Reproducible Research

The following software programs are key to Reproducible Research:

- Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
    - Windows: [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/), [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (Requires Win10)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide), or use the shell that is included with [Git Bash](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - macOS: Built in Terminal or [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
    - Linux: Built in Shell, [Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html), or [Tilda](https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda)
- Version Control System (VCS): [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Programming Language: [R](http://cran.r-project.org/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), etc.
- Swiss Army Knife of Document Conversion: [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases)

Optional:

- [LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/ftp.html): Your Favoriate Distribution of \LaTeX 
  if you wish to compile PDFs

## Editors

### Code Editors

The previously listed suite of software programs left out _editors_. 

**Editors** are applications that can be used to view, write, or modify code.

_Nowadays_, editors are far more power with features such as:

- Code syntax highlighting for functions and variable types;
- Fuzzy Autocompletion of function names and file paths;
- Context-specific autocompletion of variable names;
- Code diagnostics indicating potential line errors, styling issues;
- Source code search across multiple files within a project;
- Automatic line indentation and closure of parentheses;
- Reformat code to adhere to a style guide;
- Code templates for commonly used snippets of code.

### Possible Code Editors

Here are a _few_ programs to consider as potential candidates to write code
in:

- Notepad/TextEdit: Featureless text editor
- [vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi)/[vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor))/[nano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano): CLI text editors
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)/[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): GUI editors that are cross-platform
- [RStudio](http://rstudio.com/ide/download): Integrated Developer Environment for R 
    - Not great for languages _outside_ of R.
- [TextMate](https://macromates.com/) (macOS): Highly versatile GUI text editor

For the most part, examples within this course will done using either
`RStudio` or the `vi` text editor.

# CLI

## Intro Shell

### GNU Bash (Unix Shell)

```{r gerwinski_gnu_head, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='3cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gerwinski-gnu-head.png")
```

- `GNU` is a free software environment that stands for "GNU's Not Unix"
    - Recursive acronym
    - Logo is a gnu head (see above)
- `Bourne-Again` Shell (`bash`) written by **Brian Fox** for the [GNU Project](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.en.html)
    - Used on most Linux operating systems and on macOS.
    - Released in 1989

### Accessing `bash` in *RStudio*

- By default, this is included in RStudio:
     - `Tools` $\Rightarrow$ `Shell...`

```{r access_shell, out.width = "4cm", fig.retina = NULL, fig.align='center', cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/access_shell.png")
```

- **Note:** This may not be the case on Windows as you may only receive
the command line prompt.

### Grab a copy of `bash`

- If on Windows, please install the **[`git bash`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)** 
  shell. 
    - This outside of the `GitHub Desktop`.
- In addition, Windows users may want to emulate shell in more depth with:
    - `cygwin` ([instructions](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/installing-amazon-web-services-command-line-interface-aws-cli-for-windows-os-x-and-linux-2/) skip over the AWS parts); or 
    - Bash on Windows / Windows Linux Subsystems (Windows 10 Required) ([instructions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide))

### Bash Shell

The bash shell looks like so:

```{r bourne_shell, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='15cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/bourne_shell.png")
```

## File System

### Bash Prompt

When logged into `bash` it is traditional to see on the left hand side:

```{bash, eval = F}
[username@hostname:directory]$
```

In my case, I have:

```{bash, eval = F}
[balamut2@golubh3:~]$
```

- The `~` means "home directory" or `/home/username`

### Directory Structure

Traditional directory structure on _Linux_ is given as:

```{r directory_structure, cache = TRUE, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='2.5cm'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/tikz/directory_structure.pdf")
```

Each operating system has a different location for the user _home_
directory

- Windows: `C:/Users/balamut2`
    - Cygwin: `/cygdrive/c/Users/balamut2/` or WSL: `/mnt/c/Users/balamut2/`
- macOS: `/Users/balamut2`

### Path Structure

There are two forms of path structures you may encounter:

- **Fixed** or **Absolute**: Specifying the path from the root (`/`) directory
```
C:/Users/James/Hypno/Toad.R
/etc/Renviron.site
/Users/James/URA/reports/summary.docx
```
- **Relative**: Resolve from the present working directory location
```
Hypno/Toad.R
Renviron.site
URA/reports/summary.docx
```

The _best_ path structure to use is **Relative**.

1. Why is relative the best? 
1. What kind of path is `~/Documents/orange.txt`?

### Special File System Directories

There are two special file system directory names available in **every**
directory and program. 

- `.` (period): The present directory.
- `..` (two periods): The parent directory.

These special symbols provide great flexibility for _relative_ paths.

## Using Commands

### Unix Prompt commands

- **Syntax:** `command [option] [source file(s)] [target file]`
    - Options often have the `-x` or `--xxx` format
    - Use `Tab` to autocomplete source file / target file name.

### Advanced Unix Command Usage

**Basics of the Unix Philosophy**

> Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
>
> --- [Eric Steven Raymond (The Art of Unix Programming)](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html#id2877537)

Each command shown next is meant to address a _specific_ need. 

Needs are brought together by a series of operators:

- Chain operations together via pipe operator `|`
- Execute the next command _if_ the previous one succeeds using `&&`
- Redirection operators `<`, `>`, `>>`, `2>` for input/output/error  

### First Unix Command

Ask the computer, "Who am I?"

```{bash}
whoami
```

Provides the name of the user presently logged into the shell. 

## Directory Commands

### Useful Unix Commands - Directories

| Command    | Description               | Example
|------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `pwd`      | Print working directory   | `pwd`                               |
| `cd`       | Change directory          | `cd dir/new` **or** `cd ../`        |
| `ls`       | List files                | `ls ~/` **or** `ls -la new/`        | 
| `mkdir`    | Make directory            | `mkdir test` **or** `mkdir -p mr/r` |
| `rmdir`    | Remove directory          | `rmdir test` **or** `rmdir -p mr/r` |


### Unix Commands - `pwd` - Print working directory

```{bash}
pwd
```

### Unix Commands - `cd` - Change directory

```{bash}
cd ../ && pwd # Go one directory up
```

```{bash}
cd ~/ && pwd # Go to base directory
```

### Unix Commands - `ls` - List Files

```{bash}
ls ../               # List files
```

```{bash}
ls -l ../ | grep lec01 # List files with lec01
```

### Unix Commands - `mkdir` - Make Directory

- Use `mkdir` to create a new folder for a project.

```{bash}
mkdir test       # Make directory in `pwd`
```


- Adding the `-p` option allows for **all folders to be made** if not 
already present.

```{bash}
mkdir -p new/dir # The -p makes all directories
```


### Unix Commands - `rmdir` - Remove directory

- Use `rmdir` to remove or delete a folder.

```{bash}
rmdir test       # Remove directory
```

- Including the `-p` option allows for all directory structures to be **removed**.

```{bash}
rmdir -p new/dir # The -p recursively removes
```

## File Commands

### Useful Unix Commands - File Manipulation

| Command    | Description               | Examples                       |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `touch`    | Make file                 | `touch file.R`                 |
| `vi`       | Open text editor          | `vi file.R`                    |  
| `cat`      | Display **All** of file   | `cat file.R`                   |
| `chmod`    | Set file permissions      | `chmod 744 file.R`             |
| `head`     | Display *first* lines     | `head file.R`                  |
| `tail`     | Display *last* lines      | `tail file.R`                  |
| `cp`       | Copy file from x to y     | `cp file1.R file2.R`           |
| `mv`       | Move (rename) file        | `mv file_old.R file_new.R`     |
| `rm`       | Remove file               | `rm file.R` **or** `rm file*.R`|
| `echo`     | Display terminal variable | `echo $HOME`                   |
| `grep`     | Regex find                | `grep "toad"`                  |

### Unix Commands - `touch` - Touch

```{bash, eval = F}
ls -l | grep "file.R" # File does not exist

# empty return
```

```{bash}
touch file.R          # Create File

ls -l | grep "file.R" # Check for existence
```

### Unix Commands - Search operators

Unix has the advantage of using regular expressions, regex, which we'll talk
more about later, to search for files. Two operators to be cognisant about are:

- `*` - matches zero or more characters
- `?` - matches any _one_ character

```{bash}
ls -l *.R # Obtain any R file in the directory.
```

```{bash}
ls -l lec??.Rmd # Obtain any lec<xx>.Rmd file in the directory
```

### Unix Commands - `vi` - File Editor in Terminal

```{bash, eval = F}
vi file.R # Open file
```

- Navigating `vi`
    - Press `I` to insert new characters.
    - To save changes, press `Esc` and type `:w` 
    - To exit, press `Esc` and type `:q!` 
    - To do both at the same time use `:wq!`
    
- Resources:
    - **[Interactive `vim` tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html)**
    - Try the **[vim game](http://vim-adventures.com/)** for practice 
    - **[`vi` Reference guide](http://vim.rtorr.com/)**


**Note:** `vim` is the sucessor to `vi` and still is applicable. 

### Unix Commands - Using redirection to write to file

Redirecting and _appending_ output onto a file _avoids_ the need for entering
into an editor.

```{bash}
echo "line 1" >> file.R
echo "line 2" >> file.R
```

### Unix Commands - `cat` - See file contents

```{bash}
cat file.R               # Show file contents
```

### Unix Commands - Using redirection to write to file

Using **[`heredoc format`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_document)**
enables the ability to write multiple lines simultaneously to the file.

```{bash}
cat << EOF >> file.R
line 3
line 4
EOF
```

What values are currently held by `file.R`?

### Unix Commands - Redirection Redux Redux

Previously, we appended _onto_ the file. In this case, the file will be 
overriden each time we write to it.

```{bash}
cp file.R file_overwrite.R        # Make a copy of file.R
echo "line 1" > file_overwrite.R
echo "line 2" > file_overwrite.R
```

- What is the initial state of `file_overwrite.R`? 
- After the script runs, how does `file_overwrite.R` change?

### Unix Commands - Summary of Redirection

- Note the following:
    - `>` outputs _and_ overwrites the file
    - `>>` appends to a file
    - `<` reads input from file.

## File Permissions

### Unix Commands - File Permissions

- File permissions are a bit complicated but a necessary force.
- File permissions indicate whether someone can:

| Type      | Description               | Value | Character |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|-----------|
|**Execute**| Run a file                | 1     | `x`       |
|**Write**  | Save to a file            | 2     | `w`       |
|**Read**   | See what a file contains. | 4     | `r`       |


### Unix Commands - File Permissions for User Type

- Each type can be added together to customize the access level
    - For example: 7 would give all permissions, 5 gives only execute and read.
- There are **three** types of permissions that can be assigned:

| Type      | Description                  | Position | Character |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------|-----------|
|**User**   | Owner or user                | First    | `u`       |
|**Group**  | Those that belong to a group | Second   | `g`       |
|**World**  | Everyone.                    | Third    | `a`       |


### Unix Commands - `chmod` - Set File Permissions

```{bash, eval = F}
chmod 777 file.R      # User, Group, and World
                      # can execute, write, read

chmod 755 file.R      # Only User can execute, write, read
                      # Group and World can execute and read

chmod u+wxr file.R    # Only User can read, write, access
```



### Unix Commands - `head` - See top content

```{bash}
head -2 file.R   # Show top 2 lines
```

- The `-2` limits it to the **top** 2 observations

### Unix Commands - `tail` - See bottom content

```{bash}
tail -1 file.R   # Show last line
```

- The `-1` limits it to the **last** observation


### Unix Commands - `cp` - Copy File

```{bash}
cp file.R file.R.bck # Create a back up
```

```{bash}
ls -l | grep ".bck"  # Check that it is there
```

- It is good practice to create `.bck` up files
- This is especially the case if you are working with 
configuration files (e.g. `.conf`)

### Unix Commands - `mv` - Move File

```{bash}
mv file.R.bck file_in_use.R        # Rename file
```

```{bash}
mv file_in_use.R img/file_in_use.R # Move to new directory
```

- Moving a file is the _only_ way to rename.

### Unix Commands - `rm` - Remove file

```{bash}
rm file.R            # Remove file
```

```{bash}
# Remove file in different directory
rm img/file_in_use.R 
```

### Unix Commands - `echo` - Display `bash` variables

```{bash}
samplevar="Hi stat385"    # Create a variable

echo $samplevar           # Print variable
```

Note the following:

- No space between variable, assignment operator, and value.
- The use of `$` to refer to the variable in `echo`.
