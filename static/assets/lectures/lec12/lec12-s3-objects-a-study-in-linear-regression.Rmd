# OOP

## Motivation

### Programming Up Until Now...

- In the past lectures, the focus has been on the creation of modular code via
**functions**.
- The goals behind creating **functions** were to:
    1. create reusable chunks of code
    1. decrease the probability of error in code
    1. make shareable code
- Now, we're going to take it one step further with
**Object-oriented programming (OOP)**.

## Definitions

### Object-oriented programming (OOP)

Definition: **Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm
where real world ideas can be described as a collection of items that are
able to interact together.

### Definitions of OOP Concepts

- Definition: **Classes** are definitions of what an **object** *is*.
     - Example: **Student** has properties of **Name**, **NetID**, **Grades**, **Address**, ... 
- Definition: **Objects** are instances of a **class**. (*noun*)
     - Example: **Brian** and **Grant** are instances of a **Student**
- Definition: **Methods** are functions that performs specific calculations 
on objects of a specific class.  (*verb*)
     - Example: **in_class()** and **get_grade()** 

### Think of it as...

[![Class & Instance](img/classes_instances.png)](https://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/other_resources/images/classes_instances.png)

### Core Tenets of OOP

- **Encapsulation:** Enables the combination of data and functions into classes
- **Polymorphism:** Functions are able to act differently across classes
- **Inheritence:** Extend a parent class by creating a child classes without copying!


### OOP Concept Check

- How would an **instructor** class be defined?

- How might we abstract both so that they share a common class? 


### Why use OOP?

1. **Increased Modularity:**
     - Code for classes can be implemented and maintained separately from other classes.
1. **Hide Subroutines:** 
     - Avoid having multiple method functions known.
1. **Code Reuse and Recycling Across Packages:**
     - Easily extend classes defined in other R packages or within the base *R*
     system. (e.g. [Allen wrenches](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Allen_keys.jpg))
1. **Features and Debugging**: 
     - Problematic class? Remove or easily revert class to an earlier version without worrying about
     headache across the entire system.

## R & OOP
     
### OOP in R

> "To understand computations in R, two slogans are helpful:
>
> - **Everything that exists is an object.**
> - Everything that happens is a function call."
>
> ---John Chambers


**Question:** *How* is everything in *R* an object?

### OOP in R - Answer

- In order for an **object** to exist, it must have a **class**. 
- Every object in *R* returns a class when `class(x)` is called.
    - Even *functions* and *environments* have classes! 


```{r env_obj_class}
class(3)           # Number

class(sum)         # Function

class(.GlobalEnv)  # Global Environment
```


### R's OOP Systems

- There are three OOP systems in *R* that differ in terms of how classes and methods are defined:

    - **S3:** Very casual/informal OO system that is used throughout *R*
    - **S4:** More formal and rigorous with class definitions.
    - **Reference classes (RC):** Very new and shiny OOP system that mimicks traditional
Java and C++ message-passing OO. 

- Today, we'll focus on just working within the **S3** System. 
- Depending on interest, we may later explore **S4** and **RC**. 

### Detecting Object Type

- Before we begin, it's important to be able to detect the type of OOP systems
begin used within the method.

- To reliable detect the OOP system, please use `ftype()` in [`pryr` R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pryr/).

```{r}
pryr::ftype(print)
```

# S3 System

## S3

### R's S3 System

- Definition: A **generic function** is used to determine the class of its
arguments and select the appropriate method. 
     - Examples: `summary()`, `print()`, and `plot()`
     - The `lm` class has: `summary.lm()`, `print.lm()`, and `plot.lm()`
- Generic functions have a method naming convention of: `generic.class()`
- If a class has not been defined for use in a generics, it **will** fail.
     - To avoid the failure define `generic.default()` (e.g. `summary.default`)

## Generics
     
### Generic Function

- S3 generic detectable by looking at a function's source for `UseMethod()`

```{r generic_summary}
summary
```

### Viewing S3 Methods Associated with Generic

```{r method_summary, eval = F}
# All classes with a summary.*() function
methods(summary)
```

```{r method_summary_eval, echo = FALSE}
# All classes with a summary.*() function
methods(summary)[1:2] # Restrict output
```

```{r method_data_frame, eval = FALSE}
# Methods using a particular class
methods(class='matrix')
```

```{r method_data_frame_eval, echo = FALSE}
# Methods using a particular class
methods(class='matrix')[1:6]
```

**Note:** Output has been suppressed, there are considerably more usages. 
Try running the commands yourself!

## Construction

### Constructing an S3 Object

Part of S3's ability to be informal is the ease of construction.

There are two different flavors of construction:

- All in one
- The two-step

These constructions are **informal** as there is no forced upfront
definition of a *class*.

### Constructing an S3 Object - One Step

```{r one_step}
# ----- One Step S3 Construct

# Create object `shawn` and assign class `student`
shawn = structure(list(), class = "student")

class(shawn)              # Check class
str(shawn)                # Structure
```

### Constructing an S3 Object - Two Step by Class

```{r two_step}
# ----- Two Step S3 Construct

shawn = list()            # Create object shawn
                          # as a list class

class(shawn) = "student"  # then set class to student

class(shawn)              # Check obj type

str(shawn)                # Structure
```

### Constructing an S3 Object - Two Step by Attribute

```{r two_step_attrib}
# ----- Two Step S3 Construct with Attributes

shawn = list()                   # Create object shawn
                                 # as a list class

attr(shawn,"class") = "student"  # Set class to student

class(shawn)                     # Check obj type

str(shawn)                       # Structure
```

### Checking for Object Status

To determine whether an object is of a specific class use `inherits(x, "class")`

```{r inherit_shawn}
inherits(shawn, "student")

inherits(shawn, "list")
```

**Note:** The list inheritance check failed as we removed that `class` definition.

## Class Definitions

### Creating Classes

- Prior to defining a `generic` function, we need to establish the hierarchy of classes
and their properties.
- Consider three classes: `human`, `instructor`, and `student`.
- The natural hierarchy would be:
    - $instructor \subseteq human \subseteq list$
    - $student \subseteq human \subseteq list$
- **Note:** `instructor` and `student` are different child classes of `human`.

### Creating Class Definitions

- Each `generic` function should be able to rely upon the properties being of a specified
class. 
- To ensure each `generic` has that ability, we opt to define the following properties
per class.
    - `human` has `fname` (First Name)
    - `instructor` has `fname` and `course` (Teaching)
    - `student` has `fname`, `course`, and `grade` (In course)

### Creating a New Generic 

To begin, we aim to create `generic` function for the parent class: `human`

```{r define_generics_human}
# Create a role identifier

# method `role` for class `human`
role.human = function(x){             
  cat("Hi there human", x$fname, "!\n")
}
```

Note:

- Here we have only defined a method to operate on the `human` class.
- If we wanted to use a specific information (e.g. `student` and `instructor`),
we need to define the method to work with .


### Creating a New Generic

\scriptsize
```{r define_generics}
# method `role` for class `instructor`
role.instructor = function(x){
  cat("Greetings and Salutations", x$fname, ",\n",
      "You are an instructor for", x$course, "\n")
}

# method `role` for class `student`
role.student = function(x){
    cat("Hey", x$fname, "!\n",
      "You are in", x$course, "\n",
      "Your grade is:", x$grade, "\n")
}
```

\normalsize
Notes:

- `student` and `instructor` are the **classes**
- `role` is the method.
- There are no `object`s! (No instances.)

### `UseMethod()` Properties

To create a generic function, we only need to do:

```{r generic_func}
# Create a default case
role = function(x, ...){ 
  UseMethod("role") 
}
```

A few notes:

- The `generic` function will call the first class it finds with an implementation
based on searching from left to right 
- If no class is found, then the dispatch uses the `generic.default()` function *if it has been defined!*
- The `...` are ellipses and they enable additional parameters to be passed through.

### Example Call of Generic - One Class

- An initial class `instructor` in S3 would look like so:

```{r example_call_inst}
# Create object `james` and assign class `instructor`
james = structure(list(fname = 'James',
                       course = "STAT385"),
                 class = "instructor")

role(james)
```


### Example Call of Generic - Two Classes

- Here the `david` object has two class types.
- Only the first class (from left to right) will be called.

```{r example_call_two}
# Create object `david` and assign classes
# `instructor` and `student`
david = structure(list(fname = 'David',
                       course = "STAT385",
                       grade = "A"),
                  class = c('student','instructor'))

role(david)
```


### Example Call of Generic - Unknown Class

- If we do **not**:
    1. define a `generic.*()` for a `class`
    2. define a `generic.default()`,
- then the `generic` dispatch will **error**

```{r example_toad, echo = FALSE}
toad = structure(list(fname = 'McToady',
                      course = "STAT385",
                       grade = "A"),
                 class = 'humbug')
```

```{r example_call_unknown, eval = FALSE}
<<example_toad>>

role(toad)

### Error in UseMethod("role") : 
###  no applicable method for 'role' applied 
### to an object of class "list"
```


### Protecting Generics with `generic.default()`

- Always protect your `generic` with a `generic.default()`!

```{r protected_generic}
role.default = function(x){     # Default case
  cat("I have no clue what your role is. Who are you?")
}

# Try again
role(toad)
```


## Inheritance 

### Use Inheritance!

- When assigning classes to objects, use the *inheritance* tenet! 
- Write classes in decreasing order starting with the most-specific first and
then classes with less properties 
     - $instructor \subseteq human \subseteq list$

```{r inheritance_basic}
james = structure(list(fname = "James",
                       course = "STAT385"),
                 class = c("instructor", # Specific
                           "human",      # Less specific
                           "list"))      # Default Object

str(james)                               # Structure
```

### Practical Note

- Avoid calling the methods function directly. 
     - Use a `generic` function to dispatch the methods to objects
     - e.g. use `summary()` instead of `summary.yourobj()`.


```{r protected_generic_inst, eval = FALSE}
# Bad
role.instructor(james) # Not always an instructor!

# Good
role(james) # Adapts to future change!
```

**Note: Objects (instances) may change in terms of classes assigned!**

### Summary on S3

- Very informal and easy to work with.
- Be on your guard as it relates to class definitions.
- Define a `generic.default()` method for extra protection.

# Case Study: `lm()`

## Design

### Understanding the Algorithm

Before we can implement an algorithm, we must understand the following:

- *What* logic is being used? 
- *How* does the logic apply in a procedural form? 
- *Why* is this logic present?

Thus, let's take a bit of a closer look at Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
*before* we start to implement it. 

### Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

**Solutions:**

\[\begin{aligned}
{\hat \beta _{p \times 1} } &= \left( { {X^T}X} \right)_{p \times p}^{ - 1}X_{p \times n}^T{y_{n \times 1} } \\
E\left( {\hat \beta } \right) &= \beta_{p \times 1} \\
Cov\left( {\hat \beta } \right)  &= {\sigma ^2}{\left( { {X^T}X} \right)_{p \times p}^{ - 1} }
\end{aligned}\]


**Freebies:**


\[\begin{aligned}
df &= n-p \\
{\sigma ^2} &= \frac{ { {\mathbf{e}^T}\mathbf{e} } }{ {df} } = \frac{RSS}{ {n - p} }
\end{aligned}\]

### Derivations of MLR...

For those interested in the derivations of MLR, please see:

## Constructing `lm` Generic

### Writing a `my_lm()` function - Part 1

To begin, we start with the basic definition for a generic method.

```{r make_generic}
my_lm = function(x, ...){ 
  UseMethod("my_lm") 
}
```

**Note:** Under this approach, we can extend `my_lm` to work with `formula` (e.g `y ~ x`)

### Writing a `my_lm()` function - Part 2

Now, let's implement the `my_lm` default method.

```{r part_one, eval = F}
my_lm.default = function(x, y, ...){
  
  # Obtain the QR Decomposition of X
  # Not a good approach for rank-deficient matrices
  qr_x = qr(x)
  
  # Compute the Beta_hat = (X^T X)^(-1) X^T y estimator
  beta_hat =  solve.qr(qr_x, y)
  
  # Compute the Degrees of Freedom
  df = nrow(x) - ncol(x)   # n - p 
  
```

### Writing a `my_lm()` function - Part 3

```{r part_two, eval = F}
  # Compute the Standard Deviation of the Residuals
  sigma2 = sum((y - x %*% beta_hat) ^ 2) / df
  
  # Compute the Covariance Matrix
  # Cov(Beta_hat) = sigma^2 * (X^T X)^(-1)
  cov_mat = sigma2 * chol2inv(qr_x$qr)
  
  # Make name symmetric in covariance matrix
  rownames(cov_mat) = colnames(x)
  colnames(cov_mat) = colnames(x)
  
  # Return a list
  return(structure(list(coefs = beta_hat, 
                        cov_mat = cov_mat, 
                        sigma = sqrt(sigma2), df = df),
                   class = "my_lm"))
}
```

```{r combined_echo = FALSE}
<<part_one>>
<<part_two>>
```

## Print Functions

### Writing a `print.my_lm()` function - Part 4

- We can hook the `my_lm` class directly into generic `print` function

```{r}
print.my_lm = function(x, ...){
  cat("\nCoefficients:\n")
  print(x$coefs)
}
```

Notes:
- Very basic print extension.
- Here we end up calling the default matrix print method using `x$coefs`.


### Comparing `print()` Output (`print.my_lm()` vs. `print.lm()`)

```{r}
# Our Implementation of lm
my_lm(x = cbind(1, mtcars$disp), y = mtcars$mpg)
```

### Comparing `print()` Output (`print.my_lm()` vs. `print.lm()`)

```{r}
# Base R implementation
lm(mpg~disp, data = mtcars)
```

## Summary Functions

### Writing a `summary.my_lm()` function - Part 5

```{r writing_summary_my_lm}
# Note that summary(object, ...) instead of summary(x, ...)!
summary.my_lm = function(object, ...){
  
  estimate = object$coefs            # Beta Hat
  sterr = sqrt(diag(object$cov_mat)) # STD Error
  t_test = estimate / sterr          # t-Test value
  pval = 2*pt(-abs(t_test), df=object$df) # p-value
  
  # Make output matrix
  mat = cbind("Estimate"= estimate, "Std. Err" = sterr,
             "t value" = t_test, "Pr(>|t|)" = pval)
  
  rownames(mat) = rownames(object$cov_mat) # Naming
  
  return(structure(list(mat = mat), 
                  class = "summary.my_lm"))
}
```



### Writing a `print.summary.my_lm()` function - Part 5

- We can control how the summary generic function should look like
on print via `print.summary.my_lm`.
- Here we make use of the `printCoefmat()` functionality.

```{r}
# Note that print(x,...)!!
print.summary.my_lm = function(x, ...) {
  printCoefmat(x$mat,
               P.value = TRUE, 
               has.Pvalue = TRUE)
}
```


### Comparing `summary()` Output: `summary.my_lm()` 

```{r}
# Our Implementation of lm
summary(my_lm(x = cbind("(Intercept)" = 1,
                        "disp" = mtcars$disp),
              y = mtcars$mpg))
```

### Comparing `summary()` Output: `summary.my_lm()` 

```{r}
# Base R implementation
summary(lm(mpg~disp, data = mtcars))
```
