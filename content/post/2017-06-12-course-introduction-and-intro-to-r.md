# Overview

Welcome to STAT 385! The goal of this lecture is to introduce you to the course 
you've opted to take during Summer 2017 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
After providing an overview, we'll briefly talk about _R_ in the context of
a calculator. From there, we'll explore from a high-level the difference 
between Compiler and Interpreter languages.
