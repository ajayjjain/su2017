# Overview

The object of this lecture is to understand the basic building blocks of R: 
`atomic vectors` and `variables`. To do so, we'll look at the different data 
types available and describe R's data structures. Special attention will be 
paid to some interesting properties that R possesses regarding _recycling_.
