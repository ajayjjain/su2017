# Overview

Many classes simply assign students to groups and hope for the best. As this
course mandates a _group_ capstone project, we do need to discuss how to 
operate in a group efficiently. Within this lecture, we'll give an overview
to the different group stages, some tips for operating in a group, and
some  collaboration tools that may be helpful.
