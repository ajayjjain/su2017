# Overview

The goal of this lecture is to thinkg about programming in a way that allows
us -- as humans -- to understand the code that is written in a literate manner.
Structuring analysis to conform to a literate programming style allows for
the statistician, analyst, and other decision shareholders to understand the
underlying process. Literate programming in _R_ is traditionally done using
_rmarkdown_ and _knitr_.
