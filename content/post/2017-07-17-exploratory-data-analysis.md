# Overview

Data often has many patterns to reveal to us and human eye has a knack for
picking out patterns in data. However, we do need to poke at it
to understand its subtleties. Thus, we need to perform Exploratory Data Analysis
(EDA) on the data. In particular, the most basic aspects of EDA are to obtain
quantitative information that provides an overall summary of the data. Furthermore,
there are time where we will need to be able to visualization the dataset. Within
this lecture, different ways of looking at data will be observed.
