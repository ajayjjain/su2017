# STAT 385 Course Website for Summer 2017

Within this repository, the source code that is behind the [STAT 385 @ UIUC](http://stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com) Summer 2017 Course Website can be found.

Generally speaking, the website is made using the following tools:

- The backend of the site is powered by [`hugo`](https://gohugo.io/), which enables the static generation of files from [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) documents.
- The service that is hosting the website is [netlify](https://www.netlify.com). 
- To locally preview the website and convert `.Rmd` files to `.md` files, the [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package is employed which provides an interfaces with [`rmarkdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown).
- The display of LaTeX math is done via [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/).
- The custom domain name of `stat385.thecoatlessprofessor.com` instead of `generated-name.netlify.com` is done using a `CNAME` DNS configuration.
